                    <p>2019 marks the 55th Anniversary of The Skatalites. The original members had played on hundreds of recording sessions before forming the band in 1964. They backed most of the vocalists in Jamaica at that time, including Bob Marley, Toots and The Maytals, Jimmy Cliff, Alton Ellis,Ken Boothe and many more. </p>
                    <p> After disbanding in 1965 the individual members continued playing in various groups as the music evolved from ska to rocksteady to reggae. </p>
                    <p>In the late 70's a resurgence of interest in the music began in the U.K. which caused the creation of many bands such as The Specials, The English Beat, Madness, The Selecter and Bad Manners. This became known as the "Two-Tone era" and these British musicians fused rock music with the ska and reggae. </p> 
                    <p> The early 80's the music started to spread to The U.S.A and other parts of the world and bands began to emerge everywhere playing different flavors of ska and reggae fused with whatever else they wanted to throw in, including hard core , jazz and even punk. </p>
                    <p>In 1983 The Skatalites reunited to play Reggae Sunsplash in Montego Bay and subsequently in London at The Crystal Palace for the U.K version of The Sunsplash event. </p>
                    <p>A few years later they began emigrating to the U.S.A and in 1986 the first US shows began at The Village Gate in NYC.</p>
                    <p>In 1989 the band supported Bunny Wailer on The Liberation Tour and in 1990 they embarked on their first headline tour of The U.S.A. and have not stopped touring the world ever since.</p>
                    <p>The band is available for festivals and also plays in intimate club settings. Their unique infectious brand of real Jamaican ska pleases audiences of all ages across the globe year after year. "We hope you will enjoy listening to our music as much as we enjoy performing it for you".</p>

                <p id="texto"> Doreen Shaffer is one of Jamaica's finest and most respected singers. She began her career at Studio One at age 20 recording her song "Adorable You" and 2 duets;"Welcome You Back Home" and "The Vow" with famed Barbadian singer Jackie Opel. She,along with Opel, became part of the original Skatalites lineup onstage and remained at Studio One for many years. She also worked with many other producers on the island, most notably Bunny Lee and Joe Fraser. Doreen remained on the scene in Jamaica throughout the 70's and 80's until 1992 when she emigrated to the USA and rejoined The Skatalites where she remains now as the only original Skatalites member regularly touring with the current lineup. She has also recorded and toured with a few bands from Europe including Dr. Ring Ding and The Senior Allstars from Germany and The Mood Invaders from Belgium. She is often rightfully referred to as The Queen of Ska. </p>

In 1986 Ken started playing in Boston-based reggae bands and in 1987 he met Lloyd Knibb from The Skatalites who began playing with him in a Rhode Island based band call Wilson Blue and The Blue Roots. In Feb 1988 Ken auditioned for The Skatalites and has been performing with them off and on ever since.  In 1995 Ken cofounded the band Dion Knibb and The Agitators who quickly became on of Boston’s best bands and served as backing band for many Jamaican singers coming to the Boston area such as Ken Boothe, Alton Ellis, Hopeton Lewis, Phyllis Dillon, Pat Kelly, Tinga and Roman Stewart, Eddie Lovett and Judy Emmanuelle. When he is not touring with The Skatalites he can often be found playing with the Rhode Island band Soulshot, which also features his old friend Dion Knibb.</p>
